# EH-Tools
Open source components developed by the Event Horizon DLT team
This tools initial version will run under Linux and windows environments (including Cygwin for linux windows emulation)
Most of the tools are compiled in C++ under Windows OS, we provide free access to the tools as executable but will deploy open source code access if there is a demand for it, as most Open source developers seems to be rather interested in Python or Java source code
